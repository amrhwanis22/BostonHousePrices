## Installation


There is no libraries needed to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.


## Project Motivation
I choose this dataset spesficly so that I can learn more about regression and how to do statistics on row data,
also I'm seeking knowledge in why this prices change and what is the major reason for prices to go up and down from one place to another.
Finally for this project I was intrested in Boston house prices dataset from kaggle trying to better understand:
1) How is prices distributed?
2) does price differ from area to another?
3) How prices are biased?
4) Room Type distribution?
5) Boston property type?
