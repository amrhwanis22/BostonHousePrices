          <img src="boston.jpg" width="500" height="500">
          <p>I'm currently working on Udacity data science nano degree for the first project I had to analyze any dataset to answer 3 questions so I choose airbnb.</p>

          <p>However I've worked with many datasets and currently I'm working as a data scientist. This is the first time for me to write a blog.</p>

          <p>The Boston dataset is open for any one to use for practice to enhance your skills.</p>

          <p>Well I've used CRISP-DM process for this analysis which is used by many data scientist, this process is separated in 6 modules.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop business understanding</li>
            <li>Develop data understanding</li>
            <li>Preparing data</li>
            <li>Modeling data</li>
            <li>Evaluating results</li>
            <li>Develop changes according on your results</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As you probably noticed, we cant model any data here, we will just explore the data using statistical analysis.</p>
          <p>Let's get started!</p>

          <h4>Business and data understanding </h4>
          <p>Well i'started looking at the listing data and then I was very curious about what is the most effective thing that can affect prices?</p>

          <p>At the first glance I saw a low of things that can be very effective from the listing such as bed type,number of bathrooms, number of rooms, and also some data about the host! .</p>


          <p>From looking at this data I decided that these are the 3 questions that we will explore </p>
          <ol>
            <li>What are the property types according to prices?</li>
            <li>Does city affect price?</li>
            <li>What is the most expensive neighbourhood?</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Data Preparation, and answers to the questions</h3>
          <p>Fortunately, to answer all of the questions I didn't need to use all the features in the dataset it was huge i only needed feature that was almost clean so I had to do very little changes.</p>

          <p>The main features that I used for the analysis were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>accommodates: number of persons</li>
              <li>bathrooms: number of bathrooms</li>
              <li>bedrooms: number of bedrooms</li>
              <li>beds :number of beds</li>
              <li>price: price of unit</li>
              <li>guests_included: number of gusts</li>
              <li>number_of_reviews: reviews this host got</li>
              <li>review_scores_rating: review score</li>
              <li>amenities: tv,wifi etc.</li>
              <li>city: in which city this apt,room,etc.</li>
              <li>neighbourhood: in which neighbourhood</li>
              <li>host_is_superhost: is host is super generous</li>
              <li>property_type: apt, house, shared room, etc. </li>
              <li>minimum nights: minimum number of nights that gust can stay. </li>
              <li>maximum nights: maximum number of nights that gust can stay. </li>
            </ul>
          <p>Now after explaining features used in a high level it's time to view some statistics and charts. </p>

            <h4>1. What are the property types according to prices?</h4>

          <img src="Pictures/pptype.PNG" width="500" height="500">

          <p>As we can see from our chart shows that for all property types that the range goes from around 24$ to 2500$, and that apartment has the most expensive value</p>
          <img src="Pictures/roomdist.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>Also we can see from our image that the most rented types are Entire house/apt coming next private room.</p>

          <h4>2. Does city affect price?</h4>
          <img src="Pictures/citycleansed.PNG" width="500" height="500">

          <p>
            To answer this question we need to go a little bit deeper into features as we can see that South End Boston is the most expensive, also we can do more things to check on bathrooms and bedrooms 
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/bedrooms.PNG" width="500" height="500">

          <p>We can conclude from here that the bedrooms increase the price of property and apt</p>
          <img src="Pictures/bathrooms.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>Also the price of bathrooms increase till reaches 4 bathrooms that each house/apt that has up to 4 bathrooms it's rented for 1200$</p>
          <h4>3.What is the most expensive neighbourhood ?</h4>

          <img src="Pictures/neigbour.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>
            Well it seems that some neighbourhoods are more expensive which reached more than 300$, also South Boston Waterfront seems to be the most expensive, I think it worth.
          </p>
          <p>

            Hope you enjoyed reading my post and here is a bonus chart for you.
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/corrlistings.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>
            the correlation between prices and other data from here we can conclude when the correlation values nears to 1 then it's highly correlated data the max value from this chart between number of beds and accommodates which is 80% .
