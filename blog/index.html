          <img src="boston.jpg" width="250" height="200">
          <p>I'm currently working on Udacity data science nano degree for the first project I had to analyze any dataset to answer 3 questions so I choose airbnb.</p>

          <p>However I've worked with many datasets and currently I'm working as a data scientist. This is the first time for me to write a blog.</p>

          <p>The Boston dataset is open for any one to use for practice to enhance your skills.</p>

          <p>As you probably noticed, we can't model any data here, we will just explore the data using statistical analysis.</p>
          <p>Let's get started!</p>

          <h4>Business and data understanding </h4>
          <p>Well i'started looking at the listing data and then I was very curious about what is the most effective thing that can affect prices?</p>

          <p>At the first glance I saw a low of things that can be very effective from the listing such as bed type,number of bathrooms, number of rooms, and also some data about the host!</p>


          <p>From looking at this data I decided that these are the 3 questions that we will explore.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What are the property types according to prices?</li>
            <li>Does city affect price?</li>
            <li>What is the most expensive neighbourhood?</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Data Preparation, and answers to the questions</h3>
          <p>Fortunately, to answer all of the questions I didn't need to use all the features in the dataset it was huge i only needed feature that was almost clean so I had to do very little changes.</p>

          <p>The main features that I used for this analysis were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>accommodates: number of persons</li>
              <li>bathrooms: number of bathrooms</li>
              <li>bedrooms: number of bedrooms</li>
              <li>beds: number of beds</li>
              <li>price: price of unit</li>
              <li>guests_included: number of gusts</li>
              <li>number_of_reviews: reviews this host got</li>
              <li>review_scores_rating: review score</li>
              <li>amenities: tv,wifi etc.</li>
              <li>city: in which city this apt,room,etc.</li>
              <li>neighbourhood: in which neighbourhood</li>
              <li>host_is_superhost: is host is super generous</li>
              <li>property_type: apt, house, shared room, etc. </li>
              <li>minimum nights: minimum number of nights that gust can stay</li>
              <li>maximum nights: maximum number of nights that gust can stay</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Now after explaining features used in a high level it's time to view some statistics and charts.</p>

            <h4>1. What are the property types according to prices?</h4>
          <p>

            It seems that we need to know prices for every rented property which will help to to estimate the price if a new user is going to rent,
            such that houses, apartment,shared room, private room, etc.

          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/pptype.PNG" width="500" height="500">

          <p>As we can see from our chart shows that for all property types that the range goes from around 24$ to 2500$, and that apartment followed by house which means that your the prices of the apartment could be doubled even tripled from price of houses which is very interesting.</p>
          <img src="Pictures/roomdist.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>We can see from our image that the most rented types are Entire house/apt coming next private room.</p>

          <h4>2. Does city affect price?</h4>

          <p>
            Moreover we need to know if that different city may affect price of rented property such as if Boston is higher than Allston.
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/citycleansed.PNG" width="500" height="500">

          <p>
            To answer this question we need to go a little bit deeper into features as we can see that South End Boston is the most expensive, also we can do more by checking on bathrooms and bedrooms.
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/bedrooms.PNG" width="500" height="500">

          <p>We can conclude from here that the bedrooms increase the price of property and apt.</p>
          <img src="Pictures/bathrooms.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>In addition of the price of rented house increase directly proportional with bathrooms increase till reaches 4 bathrooms that each house/apt that has up to 4 bathrooms it's rented for 1200$.</p>
          <h4>3. What is the most expensive neighbourhood?</h4>
          <p>
            In addition of neighbourhood does it change the price it's obvious that prices change from one neighbourhood to another due to services included in this neighbourhood.
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/neigbour.PNG" width="500" height="500">
          <p>
            Well it seems that some neighbourhoods are more expensive which reached more than 300$, this means that every neighbourhood had it's own price during to services that the neighbourhood offer in addition of service provided by the host,also South Boston Waterfront seems to be the most expensive, I think it worth.
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/review_gustesinclude.png" height="500" width="500">
          <p>
          Moreover the prices are getting higher directly with review score which means that as long there is guest included prices may reach up to 500$.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hope you enjoyed reading my post and here is a bonus chart for you.
          </p>
          <img src="Pictures/negihbout_gusets.png" width="500" height="500">
          <p>

            At this point we can tell that prices of gusts included can be doubled to include 1 guest and two guests, in addition of Jamaica Plain has the highest rent value with 1 guest only!
